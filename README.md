In this Diagram Router and PC1 have removed the correct entry for each other's MAC
address and replaced it with PC2's MAC address. The threat actor has poisoned the ARp caches 
of all devices on the subnet. ARP poisoning leads to various man-in-the-middle attacks, posing a
serious security threat to the network. All traffic between Router and PC1 will now flow through the 
threat actor's PC2
